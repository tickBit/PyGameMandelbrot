# Mandelbrot set with PyGame

I've done these Mandelbrot (and Julia) set things, but with this program I found kind of new approach to it...

Please notice, that you can zoom the fractal with mouse.

## Todo
- nicer palette(s)
- perhaps an UI

Please notice, that the filled circle around the pointer is from the screen recorder software. :-)
